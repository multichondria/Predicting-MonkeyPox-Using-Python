This is my first python project done with my group members at Ascend at Indiana University.
The goal of this project is to predict whether or not members of Ascend have MonkeyPox given a sample set.
We used machine learning to train a model and predict the presence or absence of MonkeyPox.
The conclusion of the project was that the given variables were not a good predictor of MonkeyPox.
